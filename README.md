In this course we will learn how to write modern web applications. Short description of the course:

* Javascript and Typescript core features
* Testable code
* Async code
* Client side development React, Redux and Mobx
* Utilities and APIs development

## Material

The material organized by workshop folders, it could be that same folder will be used for several days,
we start at `w-01` folder and each directory should be self driving.

## Topics

- [Workshop 1](src/w-01/README.md) javascript project: npm, yarn, dependencies management (installation, working with cache and registry), project structuring examples (for web, for nodejs). After this workshop you will be able to create your own projects.
- workshop 2: variables, objects, collections - we will practice on daily routine tasks, this part could be a bit boring, but very important as will improve your coding skills.
From the topics: object and collections desctructuring, spread operator, map, filter, reduce.
After this workshop you will be able to effectively manipulate and transform data structures.
- workshop 3: functions, classes - the main goal of this workshop is to share knowledge how to write and combine functions, how to model the data and create reusable data structures.
After this workshop you will be able to write reusable code, omit poor functions design and work with classes composition and learn couple of basic patterns.
- workshop 4: testable code, unit testing using jest. Knowing how to test your code is very important and essential topic in software development. As we already know how to model the program data flow and how to transform it, it is time to learn how to write the tests. We will refer back to the tasks we alredy did in previous workshops and cover them with unit tests. We will think about how to design and write testable code.
After this workshop you will be able to write testable code, know how to write the tests for your code and get familiar with TDD.
- workshop 5: asyncronous code. In the previous workshops main focus was on working and testing syncronous code, however, in JS you will write lot of asyncronous code and should know how to handle it's results and how to control asyncronous data flow. In this workshop we will work with callbacks, promises and with async/await. We will take a look how to test this code.
- workshop 6: type safe code. In the previous workshops our focus was on writing primitive type safe code. In this workshop we will master our skills how to write more advanced typescript code. From the most important topics: type aliases, type guards, interfaces, union and intersection types, index types, mapped types, tuples, utility types, enums, immutability with readonly and const, generics

Next topics:
IO - working with network:, axios, got, fetch, http module, sockets(if have time)
IO - woring with file system: fs module
IO - introduction to streams
Client - setting up project with Webpack
Client - setting up project with alternative bundlers and automation utils: parceljs, gulp
Client - UI development with React
Client - UI development alternatives: Angular, Vuejs
Client - state management with Redux
Client - state management alternatives: Mobx
Client - introduction to canvas and webgl
Server - api development with node.js
Console - write utilities and console applications with node.js


## General Info

The workshop has to be interactive, we could discuss probably boring topics, e.g.configuration,
that exercises are not so exciting but for the rest you will be offered to come up with solutions.
Ideally for each exercise you will give it a try before we go through it together to better understand the topic.

Other info:

- We take small breaks ideally 5/10 mins every hour.
- Q&A would be interactive during the workshops, though planned time for Q&A is at the end of each workshop.
- In case there are difficulties with material and you have suggestions how we could make bootcamp better feel free to contact @vlashchanka and assign a catch-up meeting.
- It would be possible to share a view on the screen to discuss ideas and problems, during workshops materials and solutions will be provided with screen-sharing and in slack group
- Worth to say that the material is extremely new, so potentially expect mistakes here and there:
the course developed with MacOS, tried to make it platform agnostic, though I highly recommend review topic and next workshop folder before the classes with installing dependencies


## More advanced topics to introduce

Additional topics to discuss on demand by course participants 

* Introduction to Canvas and WebGL (e.g. Pixi.js, Babylon.js)
* Desktop application development (e.g. Electron.js, NW.js)
* Chrome application development

# Workshop 5: State management

## Topics described:

- Introduction to Mobx (observables, actions, computed)
- Introduction to Redux (state, actions, reducers, selectors)

## Goal:

After this workshop you will know how to organize a proper state management in
the application

## Sections:

1. [state-management-1](state-management-1/state-management-1)
2. [state-management-2](state-management-2/state-management-2.md)

## Hometasks:

### Hometask

Implement a `Statistics` component.

Requirements:
- it should show the best time (less is better) and the best flips count (less is better),
(time is more priority when sorting)
- take into account level, so the statistics for `easy` is not mixed with `middle` etc
- should output: `Best for 2 round(s): 03:45 - 12` below the playing cards and flips counter
- you will need to use Redux or Mobx for state management
